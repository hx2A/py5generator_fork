"""
This code was used once to programmatically adjust the documentation files. I
wanted to add links between all reference docs and to put all constants in
fixed width fonts.

The links will need to be adjusted for things like Py5Image.width, which will
try to link to Sketch.width. They will need to be manually adjusted to the
Py5Image version. There will also be other minor issues.
