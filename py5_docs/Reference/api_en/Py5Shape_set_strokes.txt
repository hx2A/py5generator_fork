strokes: Sequence[int] - array of stroke colors

@@ description
Set the stroke color for each of the individual vertices of a `Py5Shape`. The length of the passed `strokes` array must equal the number of vertices in the shape. This method exists to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_set_fill) in a loop.

This method can only be used after the shape has been created. Do not use this method between the calls to [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape).

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_set_strokes_0.png

def setup():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P2D)

    py5.stroke_weight(15)
    py5.no_fill()

    rect = py5.create_shape()
    with rect.begin_closed_shape():
        rect.vertex(20, 20)
        rect.vertex(20, 80)
        rect.vertex(80, 80)
        rect.vertex(80, 20)

    strokes = [py5.color(x * 85, 0, 0) for x in range(4)]
    rect.set_strokes(strokes)

    py5.shape(rect)
