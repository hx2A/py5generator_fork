@@ description
The variable `frame_count` contains the number of frames that have been displayed since the program started. Inside `setup()` the value is 0. Inside the first execution of `draw()` it is 1, and it will increase by 1 for every execution of `draw()` after that.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.frame_rate(30)


def draw():
    py5.line(0, 0, py5.width, py5.height)
    py5.println(py5.frame_count)
