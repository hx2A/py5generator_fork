random_permutation(seq: Sequence[Any]) -> Sequence[Any]

@@ variables
seq: Sequence[Any] - sequence of objects for which random permutation is required

@@ description
Generates a random permutation for the given sequence. Each time the `random_permutation()` method is called, it generates and return a random permuted sequence of the given sequence.

The returned value will always be a sequence such as a list. If the provided sequence is empty, an empty list will be returned.

This function's randomness can be influenced by [](sketch_random_seed), and makes calls to numpy to select the random permutation.

@@ example
def setup():
    words = ["apple", "bear", "cat", "dog"]
    perm = py5.random_permutation(words)
    py5.println(perm)  # Prints one of the permutation of words.
