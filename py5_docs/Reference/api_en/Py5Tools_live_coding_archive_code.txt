@@ description
Create a copy of the current code. The code archive will be saved to the archive directory. By default, this is an `archive` subdirectory under the Sketch code's current working directory.

This function will not work if the live coding feature is being used in a Jupyter Notebook. If live coding is watching the directory for changes, the code archive will be a zip file. Otherwise, it will be a regular Python file. The appropriate filename suffix will be set if `archive_name` does not already have it. It won't overwrite an existing file if the file it tries to write to already exists.

A suggested use case for this is to put the function calls in your code but leave them commented out. When you have working code that you want to create a backup for but don't want to pause to do that manually, simply uncomment the code and save the file. A copy of the code will then be created for you in the `archive` subdirectory.

This function will do nothing when not running through py5's live coding feature.

Look at the online ["Live Coding"](/content/live_coding) documentation to learn more.
