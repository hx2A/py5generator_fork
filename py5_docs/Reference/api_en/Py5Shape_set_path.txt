set_path(vcount: int, verts: Sequence[Sequence[float]], /) -> None

@@ variables
vcount: int - number of vertices
verts: Sequence[Sequence[float]] - 2D array of vertex coordinates

@@ description
Set many vertex points at the same time, using a numpy array. This will be faster and more efficient than repeatedly calling [](py5shape_set_vertex) in a loop. Setting the vertex codes is not supported, so the vertices will be regular vertices and not bezier, quadratic or curve vertices.

The `vcount` parameter cannot be larger than the first dimension of the `verts` array.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_set_path_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.no_fill()
    s.vertices(vertices)
    s.end_shape()

    new_vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    s.set_path(new_vertices.shape[0], new_vertices)

    py5.shape(s)
