random_choice(seq: Sequence[Any]) -> Any

@@ variables
seq: Sequence[Any] - list of objects to choose from

@@ description
Select a random item from a list. The list items can be of any type. If the list of objects is empty, `None` will be returned.

This function's randomness can be influenced by [](sketch_random_seed), and makes calls to numpy to select the random items.

@@ example
def setup():
    words = ["apple", "bear", "cat", "dog"]
    word = py5.random_choice(words)
    py5.println(word)  # Prints one of the four words
