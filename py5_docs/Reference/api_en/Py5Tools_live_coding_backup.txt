@@ description
Create a screenshot of the current Sketch window and a copy of the current code. This function combines the functionality of [](py5tools_live_coding_screenshot) and [](py5tools_live_coding_archive_code). Everything will be saved to the archive directory. By default, this is an `archive` subdirectory under the Sketch code's current working directory.

See the documentation for [](py5tools_live_coding_screenshot) and [](py5tools_live_coding_archive_code) for more information about each feature.

A suggested use case for this is to put the function calls in your code but leave them commented out. When you have working code that you want to create a backup and a screenshot for but don't want to pause to do both manually, simply uncomment the code and save the file. A backup and a screenshot will then be created for you in the `archive` subdirectory.

This function will do nothing when not running through py5's live coding feature.

Look at the online ["Live Coding"](/content/live_coding) documentation to learn more.

import py5_tools

update_count = py5_tools.live_coding.get_update_count()
py5_tools.live_coding.backup(f"version_{update_count}")
