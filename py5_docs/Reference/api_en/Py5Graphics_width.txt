@@ description
Variable that stores the width of the Py5Graphics drawing surface. This value is set when creating the `Py5Graphics` object with the [](sketch_create_graphics) method. For example, `create_graphics(320, 240)` sets the `width` variable to the value 320.

This field is the same as [](sketch_width) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_width).
