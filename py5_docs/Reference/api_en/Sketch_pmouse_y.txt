@@ description
The variable `pmouse_y` always contains the vertical position of the mouse in the frame previous to the current frame.

For more detail on how `pmouse_y` is updated inside of mouse events and `draw()`, see the reference for [](sketch_pmouse_x).

@@ example
# move the mouse quickly to see the difference
# between the current and previous position
def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.line(20, py5.mouse_y, 80, py5.pmouse_y)
    py5.println(py5.mouse_y, ":", py5.pmouse_y)
