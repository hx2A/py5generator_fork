sw: int - source image width

sy: int - y-coordinate of the source's upper left corner

@@ description
Copies a region of pixels from one image into another. If the source and destination regions aren't the same size, it will automatically resize source pixels to fit the specified target region. No alpha information is used in the process, however if the source image has an alpha channel set, it will be copied as well.

This function ignores [](sketch_image_mode).

If you want to create a new image with the contents of a rectangular region of a `Py5Image` object, check out the [](py5image_get_pixels) method, where x, y, w, h, are the position and dimensions of the area to be copied. It will return a `Py5Image` object.

@@ example
image = Py5Image_copy_0.png

def setup():
    global apples
    apples = py5.load_image("apples.jpg")
    x = py5.width//2
    apples.copy(x, 0, x, py5.height, 0, 0, x, py5.height)


def draw():
    py5.image(apples, 0, 0)
