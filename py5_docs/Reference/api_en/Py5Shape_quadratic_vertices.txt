@@ variables
coordinates: Iterator[Iterator[float]] - 2D array of quadratic vertex coordinates with 4 or 6 columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively

@@ description
Create a collection of quadratic vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_quadratic_vertex) in a loop. For a large number of quadratic vertices, the performance of `quadratic_vertices()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each quadratic vertex. The first few columns are for the control point and the next few columns are for the anchor point. There should be four or six columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

Drawing 2D bezier curves requires using the `P2D` renderer and drawing 3D bezier curves requires using the `P3D` renderer. When drawing directly with `Py5Shape` objects, bezier curves do not work at all using the default renderer.

import numpy as np

def setup():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P2D)
    random_quadratic_vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 4)
    s = py5.create_shape()
    with s.begin_shape():
        s.vertex(py5.width / 2, py5.height / 2)
        s.quadratic_vertices(random_quadratic_vertices)
    py5.shape(s)
