@@ description
Download and store a Processing library. These are the same libraries available to you in the Library Manager when you use the Processing Development Environment (PDE). After this function downloads a Processing library, it will be available for you to import in Python after you import py5.

The library's files will be saved in the library storage directory. Use [](py5tools_processing_library_storage_dir) to get the exact location on your machine.
