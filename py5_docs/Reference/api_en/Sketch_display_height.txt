@@ description
Variable that stores the height of the entire screen display. This can be used to run a full-screen program on any display size, but calling [](sketch_full_screen) is usually a better choice.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(py5.display_width, py5.display_height)
    py5.line(0, 0, py5.width, py5.height)
