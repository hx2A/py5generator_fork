@@ description
Create a screenshot of the current Sketch window. The screenshot image will be saved to the archive directory. By default, this is an `archive` subdirectory under the Sketch code's current working directory.

This function will save PNG images and set the appropriate filename suffix if `screenshot_name` does not have one. It won't overwrite an existing file if the file it tries to write to already exists.

Look at the online ["Live Coding"](/content/live_coding) documentation to learn more.
