@@ description
Create a screenshot of the current Sketch window. The screenshot image will be saved to the archive directory. By default, this is an `archive` subdirectory under the Sketch code's current working directory.

This function will save PNG images and set the appropriate filename suffix if `screenshot_name` does not have one. It won't overwrite an existing file if the file it tries to write to already exists.

A suggested use case for this is to put the function calls in your code but leave them commented out. When you have working code that you want to create a screenshot for but don't want to pause to do that manually, simply uncomment the code and save the file. A screenshot will then be created for you in the `archive` subdirectory.

This function will do nothing when not running through py5's live coding feature.

Look at the online ["Live Coding"](/content/live_coding) documentation to learn more.

py5_tools.live_coding.screenshot(f"version_%H%M%S")
