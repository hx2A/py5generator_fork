@@ variables
coordinates: Iterator[Iterator[float]] - 2D array of point coordinates with 2 or 3 columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively

@@ description
Draw a collection of points, each a coordinate in space at the dimension of one pixel. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](sketch_point) in a loop. For a large number of points, the performance of `points()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each point. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

@@ example
image = Sketch_points_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    random_points = 100 * np.random.rand(500, 2)
    py5.points(random_points)
